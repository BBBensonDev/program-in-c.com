      <h1>Program in C</h1>
      <p>Dearest worthless pile of shit,</p>
      <p>
        Writing C code isn't fucking hard, managing memory isn't fucking hard,
        yet people do shit like make new programming languages and call C a
        "dead" or "dinosaur" language (in terms of new projects). Guess what,
        fucker? C will outlive all of your shitty piles of crap you call
        "startups".
      </p>
      <p>
        What pisses me off more is that people say C++ is better. It's C with
        extra crap no one needs, sure, but if I shoved literal human feces into
        a sandwich, force fed it to you and told you "oh you complaining means
        it's actually good", I'd be sent to prison! C++ is not an extension of
        C, it is a bastardization of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there's Rust, which I'll admit I like some of the things it does,
        but it's again just C with a different way of handling memory. Malloc
        and Free functions aren't that bad! Trust me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh but you need classes? What are you? 5 years old? Going to your
        elementary school classes to learn about classes that don't actually do
        anything a Struct does better? Fuck you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stop complaining about C code, it's infinitely more readable than any
        other damn language you ever could imagine. Yes, even more readable than
        English, because C isn't five other languages that were murdered in a
        dark ally way and had their organs harvested to make something new, no,
        it was planned well, and made by people who knew what the fuck they were
        doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        And DEAREST KEN THOMPSON, you fucking traitor. C is the perfect
        programming language. All GoLang is, is a fucking mess of bullshit.
        Concurrency is nice and all, but we don't need more object oriented
        piles of shit. Also, garbage collection is so fucked. Not just in Go,
        actually Go does it decently from what I've seen. No, we should be
        managing our memory intentionally.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But managing memory on large code bases is difficult..." maybe for your
        AI-fucked brain, where OpenAI has been shoving it's vigintillion dollar
        dick down your throat to make you forget how to code, and be dependent
        on AI like it was crack! If you actually knew a thing or two on how to
        code, then managing memory becomes pretty easy. Any time you malloc?
        Free it. It's a little more complex than that, but fucking hell, not by
        a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am so sick and fucking tired of hearing JS devs retardently tweet
        about whether TypeScript or JavaScript with JSDoc is the better option
        for two awful languages that honestly don't fucking work half the damn
        time, throwing errors onto the console on half the fucking websites in
        the entirety of existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        C isn't hard, and there is a reason many <i>smart</i> people recommend
        it as a first (and sometimes, only) language for 99.9% of tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need something quick, dirty, and interpreted, go ahead, use
        Python. Python is a perfect scripting language. But C? C is what
        separates the sckids from the 10x-devs.
      </p>

        Sincerely yours,<br />
